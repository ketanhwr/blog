I'm a first year undergraduate Computer Science student at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.

I grew up in Haridwar and did my schooling from Delhi Public School, Ranipur. I learned about BASIC, Visual Studio, MySQL, C, C++ and Java from the school curriculum itself! But I exploited the internet and learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and much more!

I am one of the founding members of Progred, my school's computer club, which conducts lectures, workshops and competitions for other students interested in programming and robotics.

My personal interests are game development, web development, competitive programming, network security, cooking (as well as eating), badminton, table tennis and TV shows.

I'm a developer at [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co), an awesome group of students constantly striving to innovate and foster technical activities at IIT Roorkee.

I'm a programmer at [PAG](https://pag.sdslabs.co), a group of enthusiastic and young programmers in IIT Roorkee operating with the aim of improving the algorithmic, mathematical and programatically problem solving capability of students of IIT Roorkee.

I'm also a web developer at [WatchOut! News Agency](http://wona.co.in), the official news magazine of IIT Roorkee.

Apart from technical activities, I play badminton and table tennis. I'm also a TV show fanatic (Dexter being one of my favourite TV shows).
