I've always wanted to start a blog but I never really started writing. But this time I'm determined to carry on. So here I go.


> Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen, again and again. It has to happen.

### So, who are you, exactly?
Well, I'm Ketan Gupta, a B.Tech. CSE student at IIT Roorkee. I _usually_ invest my time into coding but occasionally I play badminton and table tennis. I also take part in coding contests frequently.

### Alright. So what is this blog going to be about?
Ah well, this is _mostly_ going to be a programming blog. Specifically, Competitive Programming, Game Development, Web Development and some other technical things will be discussed. Although, from time to time, I might talk about some weird and wacky ideas.

### Game Development? Sounds nice.
I know, right? So it all started when I discovered [Game Maker](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) in 4<sup>th</sup> grade. I tweaked around with it and made some extremely stupid games. Then I discovered [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/) but couldn't get a hold of it much since I was a noob at programming back then and I couldn't design game art either. I then started with [HTML5](http://html5gamedevelopment.com/) and made a lot of progress!

I also discovered a whole range of new technologies like [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), [three.js](http://threejs.org/), [Cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d.org/), and many more! I recently started off with Unity3D again and I'm learning a lot of new things and concepts this time.

### Cool! And what about Competitive Programming?
I started Competitive Programming in 10<sup>th</sup> grade when I came across [IOI](http://www.ioinformatics.org/index.shtml) and [ICO](http://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/). I failed to reach IOITC in classes 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> due to lack of practice but worked hard in class 12<sup>th</sup> and got through.

I got recruited in an amazing group [Programming and Algorithms Group, IITR](https://pag.sdslabs.co/) and learned a lot of new things in the past year.

### Web Development?
I started web development few months back only. I work in PHP/MySQL mainly but I've worked a little bit in node.js, python and ruby too.

I'm a developer at [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/), an amazing group full of extremely pro developers and designers who work their ass off to maintain and develop new applications for the IITR junta as well as for the internet.

### Enough about coding. What else?
I'm also a member of [WatchOut! News Agency](http://wona.co.in/), a group where people meet up on a Monday night and discuss crazy ideas. 

Apart from campus groups, I occasionally play table tennis and badminton. Sometimes football and cricket too. I used to sketch and sing too although I'm totally out of practice now. Also, I'm a TV Show fanatic. <del>(You might have already got it by the Dexter references)</del>

### Ah, the boring stuff now. Technical details about this blog?
This blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the beautiful [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) theme. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/). 

### What now?
> I'll be back.

Hopefully, you'll see a new blog post very soon!
